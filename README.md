# London Underground Door Bell
This was a repurposed real Door Open button from a London Underground Train.
It was used to activate a wireless door bell.

Inside there was a circle of Leds - that had all burned out.
The leds were replaced with fresh ones and wired to an animation sequence that plays each time the door bell is pressed.
